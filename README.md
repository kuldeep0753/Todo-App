# ✅ To-Do Application

Welcome to the ✅ To-Do Application! This simple web app allows you to create and manage your to-do list with ease. 📝

## How It Works

The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides the following functionality:

- Add new tasks 🆕
- Update existing tasks ✏️
- Delete tasks ❌

## Getting Started

To use the To-Do Application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-application.git
   ```
````

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser to start using the application.

## Features

### Add Tasks 🆕

Click the ➕ "Add" button to create a new task. The task will be added to the list, and you can see it displayed in the app.

### Update Tasks ✏️

Want to modify a task? No problem! Click the ✏️ "Update" button next to the task you want to edit. The task description will turn into an editable input field. Make your changes and click the "Update" button again to save your modifications.

### Delete Tasks ❌

Finished with a task? Just click the ❌ "Delete" button, and the task will be removed from the list.

## How the Code Works

The code for this application is structured as follows:

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the app.
- `styles.css`: Provides the styles and layout for the app.
- `script.js`: Implements the functionality of the app using JavaScript.

### JavaScript Highlights

- The code uses an array called `appendedElements` to keep track of the tasks.
- When you add a new task, it creates an HTML list item and stores the task's details in `appendedElements`.
- You can update a task by clicking the "Update" button, and it will dynamically update the task's details.
- To delete a task, click the "Delete" button, and it will remove the task from both the UI and the `appendedElements` array.
